# Jak And Daxter (ArchipelaGOAL)

## Where is the options page?

The [Player Options Page](../player-options) for this game contains 
all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

At this time, Scout Flies are always randomized despite the option setting... this is a work in progress.

## What does randomization do to this game?
All 101 Power Cells and 112 Scout Flies are now Location Checks 
and may contain Items for different games as well as different Items from within Jak and Daxter.

## What is the goal of the game once randomized?
To complete the game, you must defeat the Gol and Maia and stop them from opening the Dark Eco silo.

In order to reach them, you will need at least 72 Power Cells to cross the Lava Tube. In addition, you will need 
the four specific Power Cells obtained by freeing the Red, Blue, Yellow, and Green Sages.

## What happens when I pick up an item in the game?
Jak and Daxter will perform their victory animation, if applicable, but you will not necessarily receive the item
you just picked up. The Power Cell count will not change, nor the Scout Fly count, unless you picked up a randomized 
Item that just happens to belong to the game. You will however see a message saying what you did find and who it
belongs to.

## How do I get more items to progress in the game?
You can progress by performing the tasks and completing the challenges that would normally give you Power Cells 
and Scout Flies in the game. Other players may also find Power Cells and Scout Flies in their games, and those Items
will be automatically sent to your game. When you receive an Item, a Message will pop up to inform you where you 
received the Item from, and which one it is. Your Item count for that type of Item will also tick up. 

If you have completed all possible tasks available to you but still cannot progress, you may have to wait for another
player to find enough of your game's Items to allow you to progress.

## I can't reach a certain area within an accessible region, how do I get there?
Some areas are locked behind ownership of specific Power Cells. For example, you cannot access Misty Island until you
have the "Catch 200 Pounds of Fish" Power Cell. Keep in mind, your access to Misty Island is determined 
_through ownership of this specific Power Cell only,_ **not** _by you completing the Fishing minigame._

## I got soft-locked and can't leave, how do I get out of here?
As stated before, some areas are locked behind ownership of specific Power Cells. But you may already be 
past a point-of-no-return preventing you from backtracking. One example is the Forbidden Jungle temple, 
where the elevator is locked at the bottom, and if you haven't unlocked the Blue Eco Switch, 
you cannot access the Plant Boss's room and escape.

In this scenario, you will need to open your menu and find the "Teleport Home" option. Selecting this option will
instantly teleport you to the nearest Sage's Hut in the last hub area you were in... or always the Green Sage's Hut, 
depending on the feasibility of the former option. As stated before... it's a work in progress.

## I think I found a bug, where should I report it?
Depending on the nature of the bug, there are a couple of different options.
